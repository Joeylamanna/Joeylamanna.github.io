                <p> I am a Computer Science student in my junior year
                    at Villanova University with an interest
                    in coding, cybersecurity, web development,
                    and app development. I am a hard-working
                    student and always strive to learn new technologies.  
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I am a hard-working, motivated, and consistent asset to
                    any team. I love working in teams and combining ideas to
                    achieve completing projects. 
                    I'm currently seeking any offers for internship positions in 
                    the IT industry with emphasis on coding or cybersecurity.
